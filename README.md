#Instructions WeatherPy



*Use OpenWeatherMap API and citipy Python library

*Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the relationships between - Latitude vs. Temperature, Latitude vs. Humidity, Latitude vs. Cloudiness, Latitude vs. Wind Speed

*Compute a series of scatter plots for Linear Regression for each relationship for Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude, Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude, Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude, Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude, Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

*Explain the relationship for each




#Instructions VacationPy

*Import required libraries (citypy Python Library) and CSV file with weather for each city created in Part 1 (WeatherPy).

*Create a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df DataFrame as shown in the following image. The size of the point should be the humidity in each city.

*Narrow down the city_data_df DataFrame to find your ideal weather condition. For example:

A max temperature lower than 27 degrees but higher than 21

Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s

Zero cloudiness

*Create a new DataFrame called hotel_df to store the city, country, coordinates, and humidity.

For each city, use the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of your coordinates.

Add the hotel name and the country as additional information in the hover message for each city on the map.
